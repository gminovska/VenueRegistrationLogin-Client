# VenueRegistrationLogin-Client
<h3>Assignment 6 in .NET Programming class (Spring 2016)</h3>
<p>The goal is to build a client application for the venue registration service.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will include validation of the text fields in the registration.</li>
<li>When the venue logs in it should store their key as a session variable and then redirect them to a page where they can add a new show. (for now all you need is a heading on the page that says "Add show.")</li>
<li>Set up and complete test document</li>
</ul>
